What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing a repository allows a directory to turn into a git repository. From here you can commit and handle the entire version control steps like any other git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
I think it allows for an area to first try out what a commit would look like and confirm that you are actually comfortable with it. It is a test in a certain way.

I am adding a second commit here for practice.  I will add a statement in the commit message that details this.
